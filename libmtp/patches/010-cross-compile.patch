Description: Fix cross build from source
 libmtp fails to cross build from source, because it fails running the
 built mtp-hotplug during build. Looking closer, it is needed to generate
 files, which are installed into libmtp-common, which is Architecture:
 all. Since cross builds are arch-only, we don't actually need to do
 this. So all that is needed to make libmtp cross buildable is skipping
 these calls.
